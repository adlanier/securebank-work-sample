# SecureBank - SDET Work Sample

This repository contains a small banking-style web application maintained as an engineering work sample. It demonstrates API-driven development, test-friendly system design, and production-minded workflows. The project was originally derived from an interview-style prompt, which is preserved for context.

## 📋 Challenge Instructions

The original project prompt and requirements can be found in [CHALLENGE.md](./CHALLENGE.md) for complete instructions and requirements. The application has since been treated as a standalone systems project and maintained as a reusable work sample.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the application
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

## 🛠 Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run db:list-users` - List all users in database
- `npm run db:clear` - Clear all database data
